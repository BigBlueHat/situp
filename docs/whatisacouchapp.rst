About situp.py
****************************************

situp.py originally started out as an attempt to write a simplified CouchApp "client" that followed and reused the python distutils package, the idea being that distutils would take care of lots of the heavy lifting (and provide a few features "out of the box"). After a bit of tinkering it became fairly apparent that a lot of code would be necessary to override distutils behaviour. So now situp.py is just another CouchApp client.
