What is a CouchApp
========================================
Philosophy
----------------------------------------
A CouchApp is an application that runs directly out of CouchDB. It has no
external server, the database provides data and user interface. The application
may be built of one or more design documents (for example a design doc that
provides authorisation and another that provides data for the user interface).
